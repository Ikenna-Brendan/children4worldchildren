2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## üé® Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use `kebab-case` for file names (e.g., `my-component.tsx`)
- **Components**: Use `PascalCase` for component names (e.g., `MyComponent`)
- **Variables/Functions**: Use `camelCase`
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Interfaces/Types**: Use `PascalCase` with an `I` prefix for interfaces (e.g., `IUser`)

### TypeScript

- Always provide types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for object types and type aliases for union/intersection types
- Avoid using `any` type
- Use `readonly` for immutable properties

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep styles scoped to components
- Avoid inline styles when possible
- Use CSS variables for theming

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages. This allows us to automatically generate changelogs and determine semantic version numbers.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
